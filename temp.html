<h2>Understanding Customer Journey Mapping</h2>
<p>
    Customer journey mapping is the process of visualizing the steps customers go through when interacting with a business, from initial awareness to post-purchase support. This journey includes various touchpoints, such as website visits, social media interactions, email communication, and customer support interactions. By mapping the customer journey, businesses can identify pain points, optimize touchpoints, and deliver a seamless and personalized experience.
</p>

<h2>AI-Powered Customer Journey Mapping</h2>
<p>
    HubSpot leverages AI to power customer journey mapping, enabling businesses to create tailored onboarding journeys that meet the specific needs of each customer. The integration of AI allows for a deeper understanding of customer behavior, leading to more accurate predictions and personalized interactions.
</p>

<h3>1. Data Collection and Integration</h3>

    HubSpot collects data across all customer touchpoints, ensuring a holistic view of the customer journey. This data includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CRM Records:</strong> Information about customer interactions, purchase history, and communication logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Website Analytics:</strong> Data on page views, click-through rates, and user behavior on the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media Engagements:</strong> Interactions on social media platforms, including likes, comments, and shares.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Communication:</strong> Data on email open rates, click-through rates, and engagement metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h4>b. Data Integration and Normalization</h4>
<p>
    HubSpot integrates data from multiple sources into a centralized repository. This data is then normalized to ensure consistency and accuracy. By integrating and normalizing data, HubSpot provides a comprehensive and unified view of the customer journey, enabling businesses to make informed decisions.
