<h2>Understanding Customer Journey Mapping</h2>
<p>
    Customer journey mapping is the process of visualizing the steps customers go through when interacting with a business, from initial awareness to post-purchase support. This journey includes various touchpoints, such as website visits, social media interactions, email communication, and customer support interactions. By mapping the customer journey, businesses can identify pain points, optimize touchpoints, and deliver a seamless and personalized experience.
</p>

<h2>AI-Powered Customer Journey Mapping</h2>
<p>
    HubSpot leverages AI to power customer journey mapping, enabling businesses to create tailored onboarding journeys that meet the specific needs of each customer. The integration of AI allows for a deeper understanding of customer behavior, leading to more accurate predictions and personalized interactions.
</p>

<h3>1. Data Collection and Integration</h3>
